			<H1>Summer Honey Clock Instructions</H1>

<HR ALIGN="center">

			<H3>General</H3>
			<UL>
				<LI>iDevices display occasional messages such as weekly usage reports. They also tend to switch the screen off to conserve power. Other internet resources contains information on how to disable both of those features.</A></LI>
			</UL>

<HR ALIGN="center">

			<H3>Timezones</H3>
			<UL>
				<LI>The clock gets its timezone from the device. For a clock which crosses timezone boundaries,
 							the clock will by default automatically change its time and change the text at or near the zone boundary.
				<LI>For a multiple device display, you probably want each device to remain fixed on one zone or the other.
						 To achieve this you disable the "Set Automatically" feature in the device timezone settings, and then set each device to a different zone.
				<LI>For a single zone display which never crosses zone boundaries, especially in a one-zone country such as U.K.,
				 you may use the text for a welcome message, or move it off the edge of the screen -
				 it can easily be brought back on with the default position button.</LI>
			</UL>

<HR ALIGN="center">

			<H3>Calibration Screen</H3>
			<UL>
				<LI>Touching the right part of the screen displays a calibration screen which can aid sizing and locating the clock, especially if spreading the clock face over multiple devices.
				<LI>The calibration screen will disappear if the right side of the screen is touched again, or if ten minutes passes.
				<LI>The calibration screen is created by hiding a random sample of the 16 discs which make up the image: each calibration screen will be different, and they give an insight into how the image is created.
				<LI>The parts of the calibration screen continue to move as parts of a clock, although the time is not usually readable: if the second hand is hidden, the clock may look stopped when the calibration screen is on.</LI>
			</UL>

<HR ALIGN="center">

			<H3>Preference Screens</H3>
			<UL>
				<LI>Touching the left part of the screen displays the first preference screen.
				<LI>Any preference screen will disappear and accept all alterations after 20 seconds of nothing being touched.
				<LI>Touching the blank areas at the top or bottom of the preference screens will give another 20 seconds of preference screen visibility without altering anything.
				<LI>There are four main preference screens and two subsidiary preference screens.
				<LI>Each preference screen consists of buttons which either change the state of the clock, or take you to another preference screen: some also have an appearance which tells you the setting.
</LI>
			</UL>

<HR ALIGN="center">

			<H3>Preference Screen 1</H3>
			<UL>
				<LI>The first preference screen is the Global Settings which affect every timezone and both orientations.
				<LI>Note that if all languages are set to "no language", the day indicators will become solid hexagons.</LI>
			</UL>

<HR ALIGN="center">

			<H3>Preference Screen 2</H3>
			<UL>
				<LI>

The second preference screen contains settings which pertain to a particular timezone. <LI> Note that empty messages in the later slots are ignored, but empty messages in the earlier slots are displayed as a five second blank. This means that a two line message occupying the first two slots will repeat every ten seconds with no gap, but a two line message occupying the middle two slots will be displayed every fifteen seconds with a five second gap, and a two line message occupying the last two slots will be displayed every twenty seconds with a ten second gap.

<HR ALIGN="center">

<LI>Text bigger
	<br>* This has a size limit which is smaller for longer text. While text spread across multiple devices will generally work better if it is entered in full on every device, larger text with long messages becomes possible if only the part of the text visible on each device is entered on that device.

<HR ALIGN="center">

			<H3>Text Editing Screen</H3>
			<UL>
				<LI>

The text editing screen allows editing of one of the texts associated with the current timezone.

</LI>
			</UL>

<HR ALIGN="center">

			<H3>Text Editing Buttons</H3>
			<UL>
				<LI>The text which is being edited, with a cursor to show the character which is currently being edited
	<br>* Tap to commit the changes and return to the second preference screen.
	<br>* Note that any leading or trailing spaces in the edited text are removed.

<HR ALIGN="center">

<LI>Letter plus
	<br>* Tap to change the editing character into the next one in whichever alphabet is active.
<br> * If the Latin alphabet is active, the sequence is (space) -> A -> B -> ... -> Y -> Z -> a -> b -> ... -> y -> z -> (space).
<br> * Similar sequences operate for the Russian and Greek alphabets.
<br> * For dashes, apostrophes and other characters, use the Unicode button described below.

<HR ALIGN="center">

<LI>Letter minus
	<br>* Tap to change the editing character into the previous one in whichever alphabet is active.
<br> * If the Latin alphabet is active, the sequence is (space) -> z -> y -> ... -> b -> a -> Z -> Y -> ... -> B -> A -> (space).
<br> * Similar sequences operate for the Russian and Greek alphabets.
<br> * For dashes, apostrophes and other characters, use the Unicode button described below.

<HR ALIGN="center">

<LI>Letter left
	<br>* Tap to move the editing position to the previous character in the text.
<br> * If the editing character is the first character and the text length is less than 100 characters, it creates a space character at the start of the text and makes that the new editing character. <br>* Note that lengthening the text might cause the font to shrink if the size limit is reached.

<HR ALIGN="center">

<LI>Letter right
	<br>* Tap to move the editing position to the next character in the text. 
<br>* If the editing character is the last character and the text length is less than 100 characters, it creates a space character at the end of the text and makes that the new editing character.
<br>* Note that lengthening the text might cause the font to shrink if the size limit is reached.

<HR ALIGN="center">

<LI>Alphabet - the first pair of letters in the button - either a Latin Dd, a Russian Dd or a Greek Dd - tells you which alphabet is active.
	<br>* Tap to cycle through the three alphabets. 
	<br>* This will not affect the editing text immediately but will alter how the letter plus and letter minus buttons subsequently work.

<HR ALIGN="center">

<LI>Unicode - this shows the current editing character and the Unicode value of the current editing character as a 6 digit hexadecimal number.
	<br>* Tap to enter the Unicode editing screen for the current editing character.
<br> * To add a Unicode character at the end of the editing text, you must use the letter right button to create a space character at the end of the text and then press the Unicode button to edit the space character.

<HR ALIGN="center">

<LI>Text default
	<br>* Tap to reset the content of the text (not its position) to the default. 
<br> * If you are editing the first of the four texts, the default will be a text made from the iOS name for the timezone (ignoring any language settings).
<br> * if you are editing the second, third or fourth text, the default is empty text.
</LI>

<HR ALIGN="center">

			<H3>Unicode Editing Screen</H3>
			<UL>
				<LI>

The Unicode editing screen allows text to have any Unicode characters, including Asian languages.
<LI> It is easy to find Unicode character codes on the internet: for instance, you find the Japanese name for a city, and then search for "Unicode x" where x is one of the Japanese characters cut and pasted from the other page. 
<LI>Writing down all of the Unicode hexadecimal numbers for the entire text first and then entering them all into the app in one go is easier than looking them up one at a time and entering them one at a time.

<LI>Some of the 150,000 Unicode characters cause unusual effects such as text being written backwards, but setting the rightmost digits before the leftmost digits may avoid confusion.

</LI>
			</UL>

<HR ALIGN="center">

			<H3>Unicode Editing Buttons</H3>
			<UL>
				<LI>Unicode value - this displays the editing character and the 6 digit hexadecimal value of the editing character, with a cursor on one of the digits.
	<br>* Tap to accept the Unicode character into the editing text and return to the text editing screen, where you can move right and edit another Unicode character if you wish

<HR ALIGN="center">

<LI>Unicode plus
	<br>* Tap to increase the value of the selected hexadecimal digit in the sequence 0 -> 1 -> ... -> 8 -> 9 -> a -> b -> c -> d -> e -> f -> 0

<HR ALIGN="center">

<LI>Unicode minus
	<br>* Tap to decrease the value of the selected hexadecimal digit in the sequence 0 -> f -> e -> d -> c -> b -> a -> 9 -> 8 -> ... -> 1-> 0

<HR ALIGN="center">

<LI>Unicode left
	<br>* Tap to move the editing position to the previous digit, or do nothing if you are on the first digit

<HR ALIGN="center">

<LI>Unicode right
	<br>* Tap to move the editing position to the following digit, or do nothing if you are on the last digit
